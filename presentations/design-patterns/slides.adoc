= Basic Design Patterns

== `.clone()` before Lifetimes

- As a beginner, use `.clone()` to overcome compiler struggle.
- It is alright! Refactor later.

== `String` before `&str`

- Use "owned" types before references.
- It is alright! Refactor later.

== String concatenation: Use `format!()`

- Owned type `String` can be generated easily.
- `let s: String = format!("No fear from {}", "Rust Strings")`

== Clippy is your friend in linting

- A collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.
- Installation: `rustup component add clippy`
- Run: `cargo clippy`
- Documentation: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/stable/index.html

== Pattern: `From<T>`, `Into<T>`

Conversion of one Type into another.

If `X` is `From<T>`, then `T` is `Into<X>` automatically.

The usage depends on the context.

== Pattern: `From<T>`, `Into<T>` - Example

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== Pattern: What does `?` do?

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

== Pattern: `AsRef<T>`

Reference-to-reference-conversion. Indicates that a type can easily produce references to another type.

== Pattern: `AsRef<T>` - Example

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

== Pattern: Constructor `new()`

- No constructors but convention.
- An associated function to construct new "instances".
- Use https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/default/trait.Default.html[`Default` trait]. Try using `#[derive(Default)]` first.

----
include::./4.rs[]

== Pattern: NewType

- Use Rust type system to convey meaning to the user.
- Especially for Types that should be similar to other Types.
- Also used to `impl` external Traits on external Types

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Pattern: Extending external Types

- Recall that at least one of Trait or Type should be local to `impl`.
- This pattern allows you to extend external Type using a local Trait.

----
include::./6.rs[]

== Pattern: Narrowing variable's scope

- Shadowing allows you to redefine a variable with `let` keyword again.
- Use it to get the inner Type, say in `Option`.
- Use it to your advantage to make variable immutable after it's served its purpose.
