= Dynamic and static libraries

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]


== !

Let's try to use Rust from C.

== Library

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== C-Header (excerpt)

[source, c]
----
include::./2.c[]
----

== Cargo

[source, toml]
----
include::./3.toml[]
----

`cargo build` will now build a static lib instead of an rlib. `cdylib`s are a special kind of dylib that also removes all Rust-specific metadata.

== Usage
[source, c]
----
include::./4.c[]
----


[source, bash]
----
include::./5.sh[]
----

== Execution

[source, 6.sh]
----
include::./6.sh[]
----

== Woops!

Take good care of ownership!

[source,rust]
----
include::./7.rs[]
----

== Helpers

-   Cheddar - generates C-Headers from Rust-Libs.
